# Requirements for Robust Memory System
# Install with: pip install -r requirements_robust_memory.txt

# Core dependencies
chromadb>=0.4.15
sentence-transformers>=2.2.2


# Optional but recommended for better performance
numpy>=1.24.0
torch>=2.0.0  # For sentence-transformers (CPU version is fine)

# Development/debugging (optional)
pytest>=7.0.0
black>=23.0.0

# Note: If you're on a system with limited resources, you can use a smaller embedding model
# by modifying the model_name in RobustMemory.py from "all-MiniLM-L6-v2" to "all-MiniLM-L12-v2"
# or even "paraphrase-MiniLM-L3-v2" for faster but slightly less accurate embeddings.
